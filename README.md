My research and Professional experience include development of GPU Compiler and Parallel Algorithms using API's like 
open-MP, MPI -Message Passing Interface, GPU-CUDA, and LLVM-IR.

My passion for research in Parallel Algorithm development and GPU compiler is traced back to my academics where 
I had opportunity to explore programming skills and High-Performance Computing aspects and technologies used in industry. 

The unique combination of skills in mathematics, physics and computer science and being ambitious for speeding up existing 
sequential algorithm by 2x, 5x, 10x, 20x or sometimes even more inspire me to pursue this as my career.

Presently, I am working with ‘Cloud Integration and Parallel Computing Team’ at MathWorks as ‘GPU Compiler Software Engineer’.
